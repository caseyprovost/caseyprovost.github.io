<p>It is that time, when I, a senior developer of twelve years, finally staves off the laziness of not writing down my adventures, discoveries, and frustrations in respect to web development (mostly) and other things I am equally passionate about. Let’s start off by answering one of those questions that us developers have while stumbling on a blog: “Is this information valuable to me?”. The answer is “maybe”. If you like to talk about Ruby, Rails, Vue, Javascript, enterprise architecture, working in a startup, and similar things…then you will likely find something of value in these pages.</p>

<p>I am Casey Provost, a self-taught “full stack” developer who has been building apps of all various shapes and sizes since 2007. My comfortable stack is Rails with ES6/7/8 with Postgres, but I also enjoy and write Crystal, Vue, Node, and CSS. Recently I have been doing a lot more “enterprise” and have found that the interwebs are lacking in information about working on Rails in that ecosystem.</p>

<p>There are myths out there that Ruby is not fast or robust enough to be an enterprise tool and that it lacks proper concurrrency support. While that last point might be true; Ruby is still an amazing tool for enterprise companies building modern applications, proofs of concept, or even command line tools! I sincerely hope that over time and through many articles I can help spread Ruby even more than it is now and share my undending happiness of programming in languages that are just pure joy.</p>
